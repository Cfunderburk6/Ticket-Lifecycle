Inspect the ticket and communicate with customer
  Explain ticket intake IRL:
Sometimes tickets get created via phone, chat app, email, web form, or maybe even you run into someone in your hall or they roll up on you at your desk.
A lot of the time people will randomize you and try to get you to fix stuff on the spot. Itâ€™s fine to fix things on the spot, but generally speaking, you want to create tickets for EVERYTHING you do. (metrics are important)
